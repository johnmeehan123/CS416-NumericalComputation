1) Constructing a matrix via a recursive method
2) Check O(h^2) numerical differentiation.. belive this method is in demoNewtonSys to calculated the
   jacobian 
3) Applications of systems of equations -> Mod's etc need to be coded
4) Determining degree of polynomial?
5) Estimating max/min of unknown functions
